# The Ecosystem around GPT, from 1 to 3.5 and ChatGPT.
This was especially inspired by two factors:

1. The rise of rise of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat).
2. [This amazing repo](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) by Andrej Karpathy, which implements an educational, minimal version of the GPT language model. 

## Basic references 
GPT is developed by OpenAI and not eerything about the models is public. However, there are some basic papers which lead to the current state of [GPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/).

1. [Improving Language Understanding

5. [Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback

Also, since GPT is a Transformer-based model, this thorough Transformer introduction by DeepMind could be of interest:

## The Karpathy Repo
This is a minimal and instructive implementation of the GPT language model. What GPT exactly does is best explained by ChatGPT itself:

`GPT (short for "Generative Pre-training Transformer") is a type of language model developed by OpenAI. It is a machine learning model that is trained to generate human-like text. It is designed to predict the next word in a sequence given the words that come before it.`

`The goal of GPT is to generate high-quality natural language text that is coherent and fluent. It can be used for a variety of tasks, such as language translation, summarization, dialogue generation, and text generation.`

`GPT is trained using a large dataset of text, such as books, articles, and websites. It uses this data to learn the statistical patterns and structures of the language, and uses this knowledge to generate new text that is similar to the training data.`

`The main advantage of GPT is that it can generate realistic and coherent text without being explicitly programmed to do so. This makes it a powerful tool for tasks that require the generation of human-like text, such as chatbots, language translation, and content creation.`
